# Stochastic-Modeling_-James-River-VA-

The notebook file shows the computation for large flood events (100 year and 500 year events) and drought events (7Q10 event) for James River in Scottsville, VA. Various distributions and parameter fitting methods are tested for goodness of fit. The work can be duplicated for other basins as well. The work is completed as part of Stanford- CEE 266F assignment.
